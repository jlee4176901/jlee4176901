I am a research scientist at the [Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.dlr.de/en/rm), the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/en) (DLR) since 11.2017. In 12.2020, I started an external PhD at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) (KIT). My advisors are Prof. Rudolph Triebel (DLR & KIT) and Prof. Tamim Asfour (KIT). Previously, I completed my MSc in robotics, systems and control at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and BSc in aerospace engineering at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I made my media debut by [fishing drones](https://www.heise.de/select/tr/2022/6/2218515032185468810) :)

My research aims to create robots with introspective capabilities, i.e., an intrinsic understanding of their own limitations, failures and shortcomings. Once equipped with an awareness about their own failures and limitations, robots will be able to avoid catastrophic effects by modifying their own behavior towards safety. This will lead to more explainable Artificial Intelligence and more reliable robotic systems for wider industrial deployments.
